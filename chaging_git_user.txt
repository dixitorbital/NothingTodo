1. getting a PAT 
settings->developer settings->PAT(classic)->scope-repo

2. 
Control Panel → Credential Manager → Windows Credentials
Look for:

git:https://github.com

That stored credential decides which GitHub account is used.
If want to change it remove git://https:://github.com user

now try to push ur changes

git push origin my-branch
GitHub asks for:

Username
Personal Access Token (PAT) (not password)

Git stores it in Credential Manager.
