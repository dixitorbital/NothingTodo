1️⃣ Pull the latest changes

Always sync first.

git checkout your-branch
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main


(or origin/develop, depending on the repo)

If there’s a conflict, Git will stop and tell you which files are conflicted.

2️⃣ Open the conflicted file

You’ll see markers like this:

<<<<<<< HEAD
your code
=======
incoming code
>>>>>>> main


Meaning:

HEAD → your branch

main → the branch you’re merging from

3️⃣ Decide what to keep

You can:

Keep your code

Keep their code

Combine both

Rewrite cleanly

Example (resolved):

const user = getUser();
validateUser(user);
saveUser(user);


🚨 Delete all conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
If even one remains → Git won’t proceed.

4️⃣ Mark conflict as resolved
git add backend/userhandler.js


If multiple files:

git add .

5️⃣ Complete the merge
git commit


Git auto-generates a merge commit message—just save and exit.

6️⃣ Push your branch
git push origin your-branch


Now GitHub should say:

✅ This branch has no conflicts
