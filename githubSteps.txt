# Steps to do changes in ur own repo

1. create new repo
2. add README.md file to have main branch else u won't
3. git clone repo url
4. cd project
5. create a new branch new-branch
6. make updates
7. git add .
8. git commit -m "commit msg"
9. git push -u origin new-branch
8. goto ur profile on github, create a pull request



1️⃣ One-time setup (DO THIS ONCE)
Clone your fork (not the original repo)
Add the original repo as upstream
Verify remotes

2️⃣ Daily sync: update your fork from upstream
    git checkout main
    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/main
    git push origin main
📌 Now:Upstream → Fork → Local are aligned
3️⃣ Start feature work (ALWAYS from updated main)
    git checkout -b feature-x
    Make changes → commit:
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add feature x"

4️⃣ Keep your feature branch up to date (important)
    If upstream changed while you were working:
        git checkout main
        git fetch upstream
        git merge upstream/main
        git checkout feature-x
        git merge main

        git push origin feature-x

6️⃣ Open a Pull Request
    On GitHub:
    Base repo → original repo (upstream)
    Base branch → main
    Compare repo → your fork (origin)
    Compare branch → feature-x

7️⃣ After PR is merged (CLEANUP)

Your fork and local are now behind again.

    git checkout main
    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/main
    git push origin main
    git branch -d feature-x

    Now delete this branch to keep your fork CLEAN
    git push origin --delete feature-x

# keeping code in sync
1. Keep your fork (origin) in sync with upstream
2. Keep your local code in sync with your fork
3. Never push directly to upstream
